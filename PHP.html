PHP, stands for (Personal Home Page), is a programming language capable of managing huge database driven online 
environments. PHP is used  for creating database-driven websites. Like 
Javascript, php employs a syntax similar to C, and provides strong support for 
pattern matching and database access. PHP is an open source product. As with 
other open source products, such as Linux operating system and Apache HTTP 
server, PHP is not a commercial product. It is, instead, the result of 
contributions from a community of interested developers. PHP is now available 
on a large number of platforms. It is compatible with Windows NT as well as 
several UNIX operating systems, and with a number of HTTP servers such as 
Apache, Microsoft’s IIS, and Netscape Enterpriseserver. </p></font><br><br>
